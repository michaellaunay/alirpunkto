                        transformation towards social justice, sustainability and democracy. It
                        supports individuals and transforms the existing economic, social and
                        political system towards a just, sustainable, and happy society, called the
                        Society of Agreement. You can participate in two ways: (1) as an Ordinary
                        Member of our Community, with a simple registration process, no financial
                        commitments, but no voting rights; or (2) as a Cooperator, a full member of
                        our Cooperative, with a registration process ensuring that a given person
                        can register once only (to ensure the democratic principle "one person = one
                        vote") and that only citizens of the European Union are Cooperators, with
                        the commitment to purchase at least one share and to pay a yearly
                        contribution, and full voting rights.

In order to perform the computation, you should first multiply the FIRST NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 9 by the SECOND NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 9. Once you have the result of this multiplication, you should add to that result the THIRD NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 9. You should finally write down the result of this last addition in the box provided for the result of the arithmetic computation you are performing (among the four that we sent to you, identified from A to D).

                        <p>As a Cooperator, you will participate in all our decisions. These decisions are adopted along rigorous democratic procedures, and can have important consequences for the Cooperative and for the Cooperators. In addition, the Cooperative intends to represent the EU citizens, independently from their nationality - but EU citizens only. This is particularly important during public elections. We hence need to ensure three things: (1) that a given person can register no more than once, so as to ensure the democratic principle "one person = one vote"; (2) that all Cooperators are at least of legal age and (3) that only citizens of the European Union are Cooperators.</p>
                        <p>This is why we will verify from you some elements of your identity data, by comparing (1) the data that you will introduce on this form upon your registration with (2) the information present on your official identity documents. This verification will be performed by a set of ##variable = NUMBER OF VERIFIERS## randomly-selected members of the Cooperative, the Verifiers of your application, and will be based upon information regarding your official identity documents that you will transmit to them directly, by e-mail or during a videoconference, with no transit through this online platform (for the sake of security and confidentiality).</p>
                        <p>The data that we request from you and that the Verifiers will check for conformity with the data on your official identity documents is:
                        <ul>
                        <li>your name(s) and surname(s);</li>

                        <li>your citizenship.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>Only one person bears your name(s), your surname(s) and your date of birth: you. If you attempt to register again, you will need to provide the same data to our verification procedure, and we will reject your application, because you already are a Cooperator, and cannot have several accounts to vote more than once. We will be confident in doing so because we know that only one person has this combination of name(s), surname(s) and date of birth. Your date of birth enables us to verify that you are of legal age, and your citizenship enables us to ensure that you are indeed a citizen of the European Union.</p>
                        <p>This data will be used exclusively for us to verify your identity, your age and your citizenship, and to manage your account as a Cooperator. It will not be transmitted or sold to anyone, except to fulfill legal requirements by public authorities.
