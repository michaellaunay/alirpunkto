## Human Cooperative Candidate awaiting verification

The state of the Member part of the Application in AlirPunkto is DRAFT.
The uniqueness of identity data (last name(s), first name(s), date of birth) has been verified in the list of existing Cooperators (cooperatorsGroup, candidatesMissingShareGroup, candidatesMissingYearContribGroup, candidatesMissingShareYearContribGroup, sanctionedGroup, sanctionedMissingYearContribGroup) and in former Cooperators (resigned or excluded) whose identity data is still in the database because they have not been reimbursed and the Quarantine period has not yet passed, so the Application part in AlirPunkto is in the UNIQUE_DATA state.
If the candidate does not declare having sent the verification email, alirpunkto does nothing until a verifier logs in with the voting URL. Alirpunkto can remind the candidate.
If the candidate indicates having sent the verification email, then alirpunkto notifies the verifiers in turn.

## Rejected human cooperative candidate

If the Verifiers have not validated the candidate's identity data, the member becomes an Ordinary Member of the Community with full rights (see above).
They are informed that the validation procedure for their identity data has failed, and that they are therefore only an Ordinary Member of the Community.
Their identity data (first name(s), last name(s), date of birth) is deleted.

## Candidate without share and without up-to-date annual contribution

The candidate's identity data has been validated by the Verifiers, and therefore the status of the Application in AlirPunkto is APPROVED.

## The member belongs to 2 groups: ordinaryMembersGroup, candidatesMissingShareYearContribGroup.

### Resignation of a member

In this case, alirpunkto does not ask for their IBAN, and keeps their personal data during the quarantine period, then retains their pseudonym, the account deletion date, and the reason for their departure (i.e., resignation).

The administrator can exclude them in the same way as excluding an ordinary member of the Community, as the person, not having any shares, is not legally a Cooperator and therefore does not benefit from the protections that the Cooperative's bylaws provide to its members.

## Candidate without shares but with up-to-date annual contribution

The status of the Candidate in AlirPunkto is APPROVED.

The member belongs to the 2 groups: ordinaryMembersGroup, candidatesMissingShareGroup.

### List of visible or modifiable variables

(same as the Candidate without shares and without up-to-date annual contribution)

They can resign and be excluded under the same conditions and for the same reasons as the candidate without shares or up-to-date annual contribution. Their annual contribution is lost.

### List of visible or modifiable variables

### List of visible or modifiable variables

(same as the Candidate with shares but without up-to-date annual contribution)

## Resignation of a member from the groups candidatesMissingYearContribGroup, cooperatorsGroup, sanctionedGroup, sanctionedMissingYearContribGroup

If the member resigns, they no longer belong to any group. Alirpunkto asks them to fill in their IBAN.

So, as long as they have not been reimbursed for their share (= as long as the number of shares they own is different from 0), they retain access to AlirPunkto (to fill in their IBAN details) and their identity data is retained.

Every time they log in, aliripunkto reminds them that their IBAN is needed for reimbursement.

Once they have been reimbursed and the Quarantine period has expired, alirpunkto informs them that their data has been deleted and then deletes all data from the account, retaining only their pseudonym, the date, and the reason for their departure (i.e., resignation).

## Exclusion of a member from the groups candidatesMissingYearContribGroup, cooperatorsGroup, sanctionedGroup, sanctionedMissingYearContribGroup

The member can be excluded by the Mediation and Arbitration Council, following the procedure defined in the Cooperative's bylaws (this procedure is outside the scope of AlirPunkto). The procedure to follow in case of exclusion, and the list of visible or modifiable variables, are identical to those in the case of resignation, with the only difference being that the reason for departure is exclusion.
