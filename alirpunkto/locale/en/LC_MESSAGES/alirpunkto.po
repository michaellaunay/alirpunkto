"    <p>As a Cooperator, you will participate in all our decisions. These decisions are adopted along rigorous democratic procedures, and "
"can have important consequences for the Cooperative and for the Cooperators. In addition, the Cooperative intends to represent the EU "
"citizens, independently from their nationality - but EU citizens only. This is particularly important during public elections. We hence "
"need to ensure three things: (1) that a given person can register no more than once, so as to ensure the democratic principle \"one person "
"= one vote\"; (2) that all Cooperators are at least of legal age and (3) that only citizens of the European Union are Cooperators.</p>\n"
"    <p>This is why we will verify from you some elements of your identity data, by comparing (1) the data that you will introduce on this "
"form upon your registration with (2) the information present on your official identity documents. This verification will be performed by a "
"set of randomly-selected members of the Cooperative, the Verifiers of your application, and will be based upon information regarding your "
"official identity documents that you will transmit to them directly, by e-mail or during a videoconference, with no transit through this "
"online platform (for the sake of security and confidentiality).</p>\n"
"    <p>The data that we request from you and that the Verifiers will check for conformity with the data on your official identity "

"    <li>your date of birth;</li>\n"
"    <li>your citizenship.</li>\n"
"    </ul></p>\n"
"    <p>Only one person bears your name(s), your surname(s) and your date of birth: you. If you attempt to register again, you will need to "
"provide the same data to our verification procedure, and we will reject your application, because you already are a Cooperator, and cannot "
"have several accounts to vote more than once. We will be confident in doing so because we know that only one person has this combination "
"of name(s), surname(s) and date of birth. Your date of birth enables us to verify that you are of legal age, and your citizenship enables "
"us to ensure that you are indeed a citizen of the European Union.</p>\n"
"    <p>This data will be used exclusively for us to verify your identity, your age and your citizenship, and to manage your account as a "

"   <li><b>Arrange a video conference meeting:</b> Alternatively, you may opt for a video conference session where you can present your "

" </ul>\n"
" <p>In both cases, we advise you, for security reasons, that you hide, on your official identity document, your place of birth and the "
