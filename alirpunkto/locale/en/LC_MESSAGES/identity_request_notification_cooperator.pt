    <h1 tal:omit-tag="textual">Hello <span tal:replace="full_name">Applicant's Name</span>,</h1>
    <p tal:omit-tag="textual">Thank you for submitting your application to <span tal:replace="domain_name">Domain name</span>! </p>
    <p tal:omit-tag="textual">During your registration as a Cooperator, you have just provided the the following information, as they appear in your official identity documents:</p>
    <ul tal:omit-tag="textual">
        <li tal:omit-tag="textual">All your given names (in their official transcription in Latin characters for Greek and Bulgarian),</li>
        <li tal:omit-tag="textual">All your family names at birth (in their official transcription in Latin characters for Greek and Bulgarian),</li>
        <li tal:omit-tag="textual">Your date of birth,</li>
        <li tal:omit-tag="textual">Your nationality (among the nationalities of EU Member States only).</li>
    </ul>
    <p tal:omit-tag="textual">A set of 3 to 7 randomly-selected Cooperators, called your Verifiers, will check that the information that you just provided on our registration platform matches that on your official ID documents. During the next step, you will transmit via e-mail, using an automatically-generated template that we will provide you, directly to these Verifiers, without (for the sake of security and of confidentiality) using our IT platform: (a) a recent selfie of you and (b) a partial picture of your official ID document.</p>
    <p tal:omit-tag="textual">Each Verifier will then check the conformity between (a) your recent selfie and the photograph on your official ID document, and (b) the information you provided on the registration form of our IT platform with that on your official identity document. Each Verifier will then independently vote on our IT platform on this verification of conformity. If a majority of Verifiers validates that (a) your recent selfie matches the picture on your official ID document and that (b) the information that you provided on our registration platform matches that on your official ID documents, we will have the pleasure to welcome you as a Cooperator!</p>

    <p tal:omit-tag="textual">Should email sending fail for any reason, an error message will be logged and an attempt will be made to send an email to the administrator.</p>
     <p tal:omit-tag="textual">If you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact the administrator at: {$administrator}.</p>
