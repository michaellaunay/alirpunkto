    <h1>Your help is needed to verify the Identity Data of a candidate Cooperator!</h1>
    
    <p>Dear <span tal:replace="verifier" tal:condition="exists:user">Verifiers's Pseudonym</span>,</p>

<p>As you may remember, you have been randomly selected by the <span tal:replace="domain_name">Domain Name</span> platfom to act as a Verifier, whose task is to verify the identity of a person that has just registered on line. To our knowledge, you have not voted yet. Please do so at the following URL: {subject_url}, on or before {date_end_vote}, which means in {notice_time_verifiers} days! Please act swiftly.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here is a reminder of the process of verification of the identity data of a newly registered person.</p>

<p>At each new registration on the <span tal:replace="domain_name">Domain Name</span> platfom, the system randomly selects {number_verifiers} existing members, and requests them to verify the identity of the newly registered person. Indeed, it is important to check that each natural person is related to one member on the platform and to one only, that his/her citizenship is among those of the Member States of the European Union, and that s/he has reached the age of majority (18 years). Thereby, we avoid that a given natural person vote several times on the platform under several different pseudonyms, and ensure that we represent the interests of citizens of the European Union only.</p>

<p>In order to perform this verification of this person's identity, you just need to follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> you have received on {date_confirmation_Applicant_ready} an e-mail from the person that has just registered on the platform (if not, please check your spam folder, or write to the person). The e-mail address of this person, from which s/he sent you his/her e-mail (and to which to write in case you received nothing), is {subject_email}. This e-mail contained (1) a recent selfie and (2) a scan of an official identity document. For security reasons, we advise the person who has just registered to hide his/her place of birth, number of ID document and signature when scanning: the copy will be deliberately incomplete;</li>
<li> at the latest on {date_end_vote}, access the following URL: {subject_url}. On this page, you will decide whether (1) the recent selfie of the person matches the photograph on his/her ID document and (2) the Identity Data received from this person (which will be displayed on the page and is reproduced below) match those present on the official identity document, a copy of which you have received by e-mail from the newly registered person. Be very careful! In order for you to accept the registration, ALL elements must be strictly IDENTICAL between the Identity Data received upon registration, and those on the official identity document. In all other cases, even with a single, minor difference, if you doubt the authenticity of the official identity document, you MUST refuse the registration. You can be less strict regarding the match between the photograph and the selfie: please consider the effects of age and of the differences in lighting, background, etc. If you know how to do it, we also request that you verify that the date at which the selfie was taken is the date when the e-mail was sent, or at least is close to it;</li>
<li> Once you have performed this operation, and whatever its outcome, we kindly request that you destroy from your computer all copies you may have of the selfie and of the official identity document that you have received from the newly registered person, and that you report to him/her about this destruction, by sending him/her an e-mail at {subject_email}.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Identity Data received from the person upon his/her registration, which is also displayed on the voting page, is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Family name(s): {subject_last_name}</li>
<li> Given name(s): {subject_first_name}</li>
<li> Date of birth: {birth_date}</li>
<li> Citizenship: {citizenship}</li> 
</ul>
<p>The Verification process must be completed on or before {date_end_vote}, in {notice_time_verifiers} days. Beyond this date, the Verification process will be closed, and your decision will not be taken into account. By default, if no Verifier has voted upon this date, the registration will be refused. Every new member is a blessing and an opportunity for <span tal:replace="domain_name">Domain Name</span>! We must be grateful of the effort and the courage of every person joining us. Please support that effort and goodwill on his/her side by voting swiftly at the following URL: {subject_url}, and in any case on or before {date_end_vote}, in only {notice_time_verifiers} days!</p>

<p>We thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Kind regards.</p>
