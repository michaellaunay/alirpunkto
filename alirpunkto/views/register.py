# description: Register view
#   A candidate submits their application through the "register" view on the site.
#   The site verifies that the candidate is not already registered.
#   The site collects their information and sends them an email to confirm their application submission.
#   The site creates an application object and randomly selects 3 members from the LDAP members if possible, otherwise the administrator.
#   The site invites voters to vote for or against the application.
